## 💡 The Problem
Operating autonomous agents on-chain is risky. Agents often fail due to:
* **Gas Exhaustion:** Running out of ETH mid-operation.
* **RPC Instability:** Single points of failure in network connection.
* **Market Volatility:** Executing trades during high-risk market conditions.

## ✨ The Solution
Our agent acts as a "Mission Control" for your on-chain operations:
* **Dynamic Risk Scoring:** A proprietary 0-100 score that evaluates gas levels, RPC health, and market trends.
* **Autonomous Action Cards:** Proactive suggestions to refill gas or switch RPCs before a failure occurs.
* **Persistent Timeline:** An SQLite-powered "agent memory" that tracks every decision and market state over time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Blockchain:** Base Mainnet
* **Framework:** Flask (Python)
* **Web3 Library:** Web3.py
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini Pro
* **Infrastructure:** Replit & Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)
